    "Summarizing": "**Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD)**\n![alt text](https://www.physio-pedia.com/images/thumb/5/54/Whiplash_Injuries.jpg/400px-Whiplash_Injuries.jpg)\n describe injuries from sudden acceleration-deceleration movements, most commonly from motor vehicle accidents. The term 'whiplash' refers to the injury mechanism, while WAD encompasses the resulting symptoms including:\n- pain\n- stiffness\n- muscle spasm\n-  headache.\n---\n# Clinically Relevant Anatomy\nWhiplash and whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) affect a variety of anatomical structures of the cervical spine, depending on the force and direction of impact as well as many other factors. Causes of pain can be any of these tissues, with the strain injury resulting in secondary oedema, haemorrhage, and inflammation:\n\n1. **joints**: zygapophyseal joints, Atlanto-axial joint, Atlanto-occipital joint\n1. intervertebral discs and cartilaginous endplates\n1. muscles\n1. **ligaments**: Alar ligament, Anterior atlanto-axial ligament, Anterior atlanto-occipital ligament, Apical ligament, Anterior longitudinal ligament, Transverse ligament of the atlas\n1.  **bones**: Atlas, Axis, vertebrae (C3-C7)\n1. **nervous systems structures**: nerve roots, spinal cord, brain, sympathetic nervous system\n1. **the vascular system structures**: internal carotid and vertebral artery\n1. **adjacent joints**: Temporomandibular joint, thoracic spine, ribs, shoulder complex\n1. the peripheral vestibular system\n---\n# Pathology\n\n***Most WADs are considered to be minor soft tissue-based injuries without evidence of fracture.*** \n\nThe injury occurs in three stages: \n\n- **Stage 1** involves flexion of upper and lower cervical spines.\n- **Stage 2** shows the cervical spine extending into an S-shape, eventually straightening and restoring its lordotic curve. The cervical spine forms an abnormal S-shaped curve, with simultaneous hyperextension of the lower cervical segments and flexion of the upper segments, exceeding normal physiological limits.\n- **Stage 3** is characterized by complete spinal extension, causing significant shearing forces that compress the facet joint capsules.\n\nThe Quebec Task Force classifies patients with WAD (whiplash), based on the severity of signs and symptoms, as follows: \n\n- **Grade 1** the patient complains of neck pain, stiffness, or tenderness with no positive findings on physical exam. \n- **Grade 2** the patient exhibits musculoskeletal signs including decreased range of motion and point tenderness.   \n- **Grade 3** the patient also shows neurologic signs that may include sensory deficits, decreased deep tendon reflexes, muscle weakness.\n- **Grade 4** the patient shows a fracture\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\n*Whiplash can be an acute or chronic disorder. In acute whiplash, symptoms last no more than 2-3 months, while in chronic whiplash symptoms last longer than three months. Patients with acute WAD experience widespread pressure hypersensitivity and reduced cervical mobility.  Various studies indicate that there can be a spontaneous recovery within 2-3 months.*\n\n*Whiplash-associated disorder is a complex condition with varied disturbances in motor, sensorimotor, and sensory functions and psychological distress. It is important to carry out thorough spinal and neurological examinations in patients with WAD to screen for delayed onset of the cervical spine instability or myelopathy. The most common symptoms are sub-occipital headache which appears or increases within seven days after the injury.*\n\n**Primary Motor Features**\n\n- Restricted range of motion of the cervical spine\n- Altered patterns of muscle recruitment in both the cervical spine and shoulder girdle regions (clearly a feature of chronic WAD)\n- Mechanical cervical spine instability\n\n**Sensorimotor Features (Greater in patients who also report dizziness due to the neck pain)**\n- Loss of balance\n- Disturbed neck influenced eye movement control\n\n**Sensory and Psychological Features**\n\n- Psychological distress\n- Post-traumatic stress\n- Concentration and memory problems\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Anxiety\n> - Post traumatic stress and anxiety are more common in women (19.7% and 11.7%, respectively) compared to men (13.2% and 8.6%)\n- Depression\n>-  Initial depression: associated with greater neck and low back pain severity, numbness/tingling in arms/hands, vision problems, dizziness, fracture\n> - Persistent depression: associated with older age, greater initial neck and low back pain, post-crash dizziness, anxiety, numbness/tingling, vision and hearing problems\n> - Depression may be present in around 5% in women and men\n\n**Muscular Changes**\n\n- Neck stiffness\n- Fatty infiltrate may be present in the deep muscles in the suboccipital region and the multifidi may account for some of the functional impairments such as: Proprioceptive deficits, Balance loss, Disturbed motor control of the neck\n\n**Associated Symptoms**\n\nThe following symptoms may also occur:\n\n- Tinnitus\n- Malaise\n- Disequilibrium/Dizziness\n- Thoracic, temporomandibular, facial, and limb pain\n---\n# Differential Diagnosis\n- Cervical spine fracture\n- Carotid artery dissection\n- Herniated disc\n- Spinal cord injury\n- Subluxation of the cervical spine\n- Muscle strain\n- Facet injury\n- Ligamentous injury",
    "Prognosis": "**The prognosis of WAD is unknown and unpredictable**\n- some cases remain acute with a full recovery.\n- while some progress to chronic with long term pain and disability.\n\n*Early intervention recommendations are:*\n- rest\n- pain relief\n- basic stretching and stretching exercises.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "# Acute Whiplash\nEducation provided by physiotherapists or general practitioners is important in preventing chronic WAD and must be part of the biopsychosocial approach for whiplash patients. The most important goals of the interventions are:\n\n1. Reassuring the patient\n1. Modulating maladaptive cognition about WAD\n1. Activating the patient\n- The target of education is removing therapy barriers, enhancing therapy compliance and preventing and treating chronicity.\n- For acute WAD verbal education and written advice are helpful (evidence exists that oral information is equally as efficient as an active exercise program).\n- A multidisciplinary programme is best for subacute/chronic patients, with a programme integrating information, exercises and behavioural programmes.\n\nDifferent types of education include:\n1. **Oral Education:** Provide oral education concerning the whiplash mechanisms and emphasising physical activity and correct posture. It has a better effect on pain, cervical mobility, and recovery, compared to rest and neck collars. Oral education could be as effective as active physiotherapy and mobilisation.\n1. **Educational video:** A brief psycho-educational video shown at the patient's bedside seems to have a profound effect on subsequent pain and medical utilisation in acute whiplash patients, compared to the usual care.\n\nEducation and information given to the patient must contain the following information:\n\n- Reassurance that prognosis following a whiplash injury is good.\n- Encouragement to return to normal activities as soon as possible using exercises to facilitate recovery\nReassurance that pain is normal following a whiplash injury and that patients should use analgesia consistently to control this\n- Advice against using a soft collar as exercises and/or advice to stay active has shown more favourable outcomes on pain and disability\n\nDifferent types of exercise can be considered for WAD:\n\n- ROM exercises\n- McKenzie exercises\n- Postural exercises\n- Strengthening\n- Motor control exercises.\n---\n# Chronic Whiplash\n- Chronic WAD results from a combination of the injury with psychological factors.\n- Chronic WAD patients report worse health than people with non-specific chronic neck pain.\n- A multidisciplinary therapy with cognitive, behavioural therapy and physical therapy, including neck exercises is applied in management of Chronic WAD patients. It also gives positive results according to the reductions of neck pain and sick leave.\n- Behavioural therapy is used in the therapy as it decreases the patient’s pain intensity in problematic daily activities. ie adapt planning and treatment.\n- Exercise programs have a positive result in reducing pain in the short term. Exercise programmes are the most effective noninvasive treatment for patients with chronic WAD and coordination exercises should be added to the treatment to reduce neck pain.\n- In patients with chronic WAD, negative thoughts are a very important factor. Negative thoughts and pain behaviour can be influenced by specialists and physical therapists by educating patients with chronic WAD on the neurophysiology of pain.\n- Simple advice is equally as effective as a more intense and comprehensive physiotherapy exercise programme.",

  "Cervical Spondylosis (Arthritis)": {
    "Summarizing": "## Practice Essentials\n\nCervical spondylosis is a chronic degenerative condition of the cervical spine that affects the vertebral bodies and intervertebral disks of the neck (in the form of, for example, disk herniation and spur formation), as well as the contents of the spinal canal (nerve roots and/or spinal cord). Some authors also include the degenerative changes in the facet joints, longitudinal ligaments, and ligamentum flavum.\nSpondylosis progresses with age and often develops at multiple interspaces. Chronic cervical degeneration is the most common cause of progressive spinal cord and nerve root compression. Spondylotic changes can result in stenosis of the spinal canal, lateral recess, and foramina. Spinal canal stenosis can lead to myelopathy.\n\n---\n### Signs and symptoms of cervical spondylosis\n\nThese include the following:\n\n-   Cervical pain - Chronic suboccipital headache may be present\n-   Cervical radiculopathy - Compression of the cervical nerve roots leads to ischemic changes that cause sensory dysfunction (eg, radicular pain) and/or motor dysfunction (eg, weakness)\n-   Cervical myelopathy - Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most serious consequence of cervical intervertebral disk degeneration, especially when it is associated with a narrow cervical vertebral canal\n\n---\n## Pathophysiology\n\nIntervertebral disks lose hydration and elasticity with age, and these losses lead to cracks and fissures. The surrounding ligaments also lose their elastic properties and develop traction spurs. The disk subsequently collapses as a result of biomechanical incompetence, causing the annulus to bulge outward. As the disk space narrows, the annulus bulges, and the facets override. This change, in turn, increases motion at that spinal segment and further hastens the damage to the disk. Annulus fissures and herniation may occur. Acute disk herniation may complicate chronic spondylotic changes.\nAs the annulus bulges, the cross-sectional area of the canal is narrowed. This effect may be accentuated by hypertrophy of the facet joints (posteriorly) and of the ligamentum flavum, which becomes thick with age. Neck extension causes the ligaments to fold inward, reducing the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the spinal canal.\nAs disk degeneration occurs, the uncinate process overrides and hypertrophies, compromising the ventrolateral portion of the foramen. Likewise, facet hypertrophy decreases the dorsolateral aspect of the foramen. This change contributes to the radiculopathy that is associated with cervical spondylosis. Marginal osteophytes begin to develop. Additional stresses, such as trauma or long-term heavy use, may exacerbate this process. These osteophytes stabilize the vertebral bodies adjacent to the level of the degenerating disk and increase the weight-bearing surface of the vertebral endplates.\nDegeneration of the joint surfaces and ligaments decreases motion and can act as a limiting mechanism against further deterioration. Thickening and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) also decreases the diameter of the canal.\nThe blood supply of the spinal cord is an important anatomic factor in the pathophysiology. Radicular arteries in the dural sleeves tolerate compression and repetitive minor trauma poorly. The spinal cord and canal size also are factors. A congenitally narrow canal does not necessarily predispose a person to myelopathy, but symptomatic disease rarely develops in individuals with a canal that is larger than 13 mm.",
    "Prognosis": "While the underlying **degenerative changes are irreversible**, associated pain and functional limitations can significantly improve **within 4-6 weeks** with focused rehabilitation. Symptoms can become chronic if unaddressed.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "## Rehabilitation Program\n\n### Physical therapy\n\nImmobilization of the cervical spine is the mainstay of conservative treatment for patients with severe cervical spondylosis with evidence of myelopathy. Immobilization limits the motion of the neck, thereby reducing nerve irritation. Soft cervical collars are recommended for daytime use only, but they are unable to appreciably limit the motion of the cervical spine. More rigid orthoses (eg, Philadelphia collar, Minerva body jacket) can significantly immobilize the cervical spine (see Special Concerns). The patient's tolerance and compliance are considerations when any of the braces are used. A program of isometric cervical exercises may help to limit the loss of muscle tone that results from the use of more restrictive orthoses. Molded cervical pillows can better align the spine during sleep and provide symptomatic relief for some patients.\n\nMechanical traction is a widely used technique. This form of treatment may be useful because it promotes immobilization of the cervical region and widens the foraminal openings. However, traction in the treatment of cervical pain was not better than placebo in 2 randomized groups.\n\nThe use of cervical exercises has been advocated in patients with cervical spondylosis. Isometric exercises are often beneficial to maintain the strength of the neck muscles. Neck and upper back stretching exercises, as well as light aerobic activities, also are recommended. The exercise programs are best initiated and monitored by a physical therapist.\n\nPassive modalities generally involve the application of heat to the tissues in the cervical region, either by means of superficial devices (eg, moist-heat packs) or mechanisms for deep-heat transfer (eg, ultrasound, diathermy).\n\nManual therapy, such as massage, mobilization, and manipulation, may provide further relief for patients with cervical spondylosis. Mobilization is performed by a physical therapist and is characterized by the application of gentle pressure within or at the limits of normal motion, with the goal of increasing the ROM. Manual traction may be better tolerated than mechanical traction in some patients. Manipulation is characterized by a high-velocity thrust, which is often delivered at or near the limit of the ROM. The intention is to increase articular mobility or to realign the spine. Contraindications to manipulative therapy include myelopathy, severe degenerative changes, fracture or dislocation, infection, malignancy, ligamentous instability, and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.\n\n### Occupational therapy\n\nPatients with upper extremity weakness often lose their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), vocational activities, or recreational activities. Lifestyle modifications may involve an evaluation of workplace ergonomics, postural training, neck-school therapy (supervised, small-group therapy), stress management, and vocational assistance. Disability can be improved with specific strengthening exercises of the upper extremities, special splinting to compensate for weakness, and the use of assistive devices that allow the patient to perform previously impossible activities.\n\n### Recreational therapy\n\nThe recreational therapist can use recreational and community activity to accomplish the following:\n\n-   Help the patient maintain his/her physical strength, social skills, and motivation\n    \n-   Assist the patient and family in adjusting to the disability\n    \n-   Decrease the patient's atypical behaviors\n    \n-   Increase the patient's independence\n    \n-   Reinforce other therapies\n    \n-   Provide community integration\n    \n-   Further evaluate the level of functioning in cases of severe disability caused by cervical spondylosis",

  "Cervicogenic Headache": {
    "Summarizing": "**Cervicogenic headache (CGH):** is a chronic headache that arises from the *atlanto-occipital* and *upper cervical joints* and perceived in one or more regions of the head and/or face.\n\n**A cervicogenic headache** is a common cause of a *chronic headache that is often misdiagnosed*. The presenting features can be complex and similar to many primary headache syndromes that are encountered daily. \n\n\nThe main symptoms of a cervicogenic headache are a combination of:\n1. unilateral pain\n1. ipsilateral diffuse shoulder\n1. arm pain. \n\nROM in the neck is reduced, and pain is relieved with anesthetic blockades.\n\n---\n\n#  Clinical Relevant Anatomy\n\nThe cervical spine consists of 7 vertebrae, C1 to C7, the cervical nerves from C1 to C8, muscles and ligaments, The first two vertebrae have a unique shape and function.They form the upper cervical spine.\n\n\n- The upper vertebrae supports the skull (atlas/C1), articulates superiorly with the occiput (the atlanto-occipital joint) . This joint is responsible for 33% of flexion and extension.The design of the atlas allows forward and backward movement of the head.\n- Below the atlas is the axis (C2) that allows rotation.The atlantoaxial joint is responsible for 60% of all cervical rotation.\n- The 5 cervical vertebrae that make up the lower cervical spine, C3-C7, are similar to each other but very different from C1 and C2.\n\n---\n# Pathophysiology\n- The C1-C3 nerves relay pain signals to the nociceptive nucleus of the head and neck, the trigeminocervical nucleus. This connection is thought to be the cause for referred pain to the occiput and/or eyes.\n- Aseptic inflammation and neurotransmission within the C-fibers that is caused by cervical disc pathology is thought to produce and worsen the pain in a cervicogenic headache.\n- The trigeminocervical nucleus receives afferents from the trigeminal nerve as well as the upper three cervical spinal nerves. Neck trauma, whiplash, strain, or chronic spasm of the scalp, neck, or shoulder muscles can increase the sensitivity of the area which is similar to the allodynia that is seen in late chronic migraines.\n- A lower pain threshold makes patients more susceptible to more severe pain. For this reason, early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention is very important.\n\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\nChallenging to diagnose clinically, but often includes the below:\n- Unilateral “ram’s horn” or unilateral dominant headache (Excluding those with bilateral headache or symptoms that typify migraine headaches).\n- Exacerbated by neck movement or posture\n- Tenderness of the upper 3 cervical spine joints\n- Association with neck pain or dysfunction\n- Definitive diagnosis made through selective nerve blocking through injection of specific sites\n- Compared to migraine headache and control groups, cervicogenic headache group patients tend to have increased tightness and trigger points in upper trapezius, levator scapulae, scalenes and suboccipital extensors\n- Weakness in the deep neck flexors\n- Increased activity in the superficial flexors\n- Atrophy in the suboccipital extensors and so the deep muscle sleeve which is important for active support of the cervical segments becomes impaired\n- Upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, levator scapulae, pectoralis major and minor, and short sub-occipital extensors have been implicated\n\n---\n# Differential Diagnosis\nIt is important to differentiate from serious pathology such as:\n- Vascular Pathologies of the Neck\n- Intracranial Pathology\n- Cervical Instability\n- Cervical Myelopathy\n- Occipital neuralgia\n---\n# Red Flags\n1. Sudden onset of a new severe headache.\n1. A worsening pattern of a pre-existing headache in the absence of obvious predisposing factors.\n1. Headache associated with fever, neck stiff ness, skin rash, and with a history of cancer, HIV, or other systemic illness.\n1. Headache associated with focal neurologic signs other than typical aura.\n1. Moderate or severe headache triggered by cough, exertion, or bearing down.\n1. New onset of a headache during or following pregnancy.\n\n***Patients with one or more red flags should be referred for an immediate medical consultation and further investigation.***",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for a **cervicogenic headache** varies from person to person, with mild cases sometimes resolving on their own, while more severe or chronic cases require professional treatment and may recur.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "***Although this type of headache is responsive to therapy oriented at treating the soft tissue restrictions, the method of examination, assessment, and treatment needs to be specific to the neck and occiput.*** \n\n\n---\n\n\n# Treatment\n- Cervical spine manipulation or mobilization\n- Strengthening exercises including deep neck flexors and upper quarter muscles\n- Thoracic spine thrust manipulation & exercise\n- C1-C2 Self-sustained Natural Apophyseal Glide (SNAG) shown to be effective for reducing cervicogenic headache symptoms\n\n**Jull et al** reported that a *six week* physiotherapy program including manual therapy and exercise interventions was an effective treatment option for reduction of cervicogenic headache symptoms and decreasing medication intake in both the short term and at one-year follow-up. \n\nAccording to the **Delphi study (2021)** conducted to get consensus on physiotherapy treatment in headaches, active mobilisation exercises, upper cervical spine mobilisations, passive mobilisation with movement, work-related ergonomic training, and active mobilisation with movement can be used in the treatment of Cervicogenic headaches."

  "General Neck Pain & Stiffness": {
    "Summarizing": "**Neck pain** is characterised by its sudden onset, typically lasting *less than three months*. \n\nThis discomfort can manifest as localised pain or radiate to the:\n- head\n- shoulders\n- arms\n\nVarious factors such as injury, disease, wear and tear, or poor biomechanics can stress the spine and lead to this type of pain. **However**, pinpointing the exact source of discomfort can be challenging. \n\nPotential contributing factors may include:\n- nerve damage\n- tissue scarring\n- arthritis\n- emotional effects of pain.\n\n\n---\n# Functional Anatomy\nThe cervical spine consists of several structural group:\n\n**Muscles:**\n\n- anterior muscles\n- posterior muscles\n- lateral muscles\n- muscles that feed into the neck\n\n**Ligaments :**\n \n- anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament\n- intertransverse ligaments\n- nucheal ligament\n- alar ligaments\n- apical ligaments of dens\n- yellow ligaments\n\n**Neurological structures:** \n- arteries\n- nerves\n- glands\n- 2 passageways\n\n---\n# Mechanism of injury and Differential Diagnosis\n\nUnderstanding the mechanism of acute neck pain and differential diagnosis are the key parts of a physiotherapy assessment process. Various sources can contribute to acute neck pain:\n\n- **Cervical muscle sprain** (Most common cause of acute neck pain, usually caused my overuse of the musculature e.g., sitting hunched over in a chair)\n- **Muscle weakness** (Training muscles asymmetrically can cause pain i.e., training upper traps more than lower traps can lead to overstimulation of the upper traps, the difference can cause pain)\n- **Concussion** (After a concussion, people may experience head and neck pain, it can start quickly after and last anywhere from a few days to months/years.) *Any symptoms that last longer than 3 months after is considered post-concussion syndrome*\n- **RTA** (Symptoms can occur suddenly or within a few days following an accident , similar to a concussion, how long the symptoms last can range)\n- **Whiplash** (This can occur within a RTA or from another type of trauma e.g., a fall)\n---\n# Risk Factors\n\nIdentifying and understanding risk factors is crucial for prevention and early diagnosis, as acute neck pain can potentially evolve into chronic conditions. Potential contributing risk factors include:\n\n1. Advanced age\n1. Female\n1. History of neck, shoulder, and pelvis trauma\n1. Psychological factors\n1. Lifestyle\n---\n# Classification\n\nAccording to the updated neck pain revision of the **Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA)** in 2017, these are the revised clinical guidelines for neck pain classification:\n\n- Neck pain with mobility deficits\n- Neck pain with movement coordination impairments\n- Neck pain with headaches\n- Neck pain with radiating pain\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\nEvery acute neck pain present differently, it often present with more than a simple pain in the neck. Typically, it is accompanied by:\n\n- Referred pain (headache, shoulder pain, upper or lower back pain, radiated pain with upper extremity numbness.) These pain can be explained by refereed or widespread pain from innervated cervical spine structure.\n- Mobility deficit (reduce range of motion)\n- Coordination impairment\n- Muscle tightness and spasm\n- Dizziness, nausea (patients with cervical vertigo may encounter these symptoms)\n- Fever (might indicate an infection extending into the brain)\n---\n# Red Flags\n- **Symptoms pattern** (worsening of symptoms, recent bladder or bowel issue, sensory changes, unsteady gait, age above 50, previous history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, severely limiting range of motion (ROM) or pain, 5 D’s or 3 N’s, boy temperature over 36 degree, blood pressure (BP) above 160/95, and resting pulse higher than 100bpm)\n- **Family history** (Any history of cardiovascular disease or any relevant pathology)\n- **Cranial Nerves** (If applicable i.e., you have suspicion they may be involved, test all 12 nerves)\n- **Psychosocial factors** (factors that stop individual from sleeping, returning to activity, or causes extreme pain), despite not including in red flags, should also be taken into consideration.",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for most acute neck pain is good, with symptoms typically resolving within a few weeks to two months.\n\n**However**, some individuals may continue to experience pain or frequent recurrences, with up to 50% still having some issues after one year. \n\nA small percentage of acute cases may become chronic, especially in those with initial symptoms lasting longer than three months.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "**If any red flags have been identified, patient must be referred immediately or have an urgent appointment for investigation. When it comes to treatment, should the patient not present with any red flags.** \n\nThe NICE guidelines and other research advise management for acute neck pain as following:\n1. **RoM exercise with gravity as assistance** (e.g. being sat up with flexion, extension, side flexion, and rotation)\n1. **RoM exercise against gravity** (progress with minimal gravity resistance)\n1. **Isometric holds** (then we will progress to isometric holds and strengthening exercises, such as using therabands)\n1. **Sport specific** (In later stage of the treatment, we would then combine with sport specific exercises, such as holding a golf club and practicing a swing slowly to begin with, then progress to using a ball etc.)"

  "Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)": {
    "Summarizing": "## Introduction\n![alt text](https://www.physio-pedia.com/images/6/66/Tos.jpg)\n\nThe term ‘thoracic outlet syndrome’ (TOS) refers to the compression of the neurovascular structures, primarily the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and the subclavian vein, as they exit through the thoracic outlet also known as the cervicothoracobrachial region.\n\nAnatomically, the thoracic outlet is bordered anteriorly by the anterior scalene muscle, posteriorly by the middle scalene , and inferiorly by the first rib .( area serves as a passageway for nerves and blood vessels travelling from the neck to the arm.\n\nTOS is considered as one of the most controversial topics in musculoskeletal medicine and rehabilitation, partly due to its complex presentation and challenges in diagnosis(\n\nThe term ‘TOS’ does not identify the specific structure being compressed. Clinically it is typically divided into two main categories:\n\n-   Vascular TOS, which may involve compression of the subclavian artery or vein and generally presents with fewer diagnostic problems.\n-   Neurogenic TOS which involves compression of the brachial plexus and accounts for more than 90% of all TOS cases.\n\nTo improve diagnostic clarity, TOS should be classified as arterial TOS (ATOS), venous TOS (VTOS), or neurogenic (NTOS), depending on the structure affected.\n\n---\n## Clinically Relevant Anatomy\n\nThe thoracic outlet consists of three main passageways through which neurovascular structures travel from the neck to the upper limb. Compression at any of these sites can contribute to thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).\n\n### Interscalene Triangle\n\nThe first narrowing area is the most proximal and is named the interscalene triangle: This triangle is bordered by:\n\n-   Anteriorly by the anterior scalene muscle\n-   Posteriorly by the middle scalene muscle\n-   Inferiorly by the first rib\n\nThe brachial plexus and subclavian artery pass through this space. Anatomical variations, such as the presence of the scalene minimus muscle or overlapping insertion of the anterior and middle scalenes on the first rib, can reduce the available space and contribute to compression.\n\n### Costoclavicular Space\n\nThe second passageway is called the costoclavicular space (or triangle), and is bordered\n\n-   Superiorly by the middle third of the clavicle\n-   Inferiorly by the first rib\n-   Posteriorly and medially by the costoclavicular ligament\n\nThe subclavian vein, subclavian artery, and brachial plexus pass through this space. Compression of these structures can occur as a result of congenital abnormalities, trauma to the first rib or clavicle fractures. Structural changes in the subclavian muscle or the costocoracoid ligament can also be contributing factors.\n\n### Subcoracoid (Sub-Pectoralis Minor) Space\n\nThe final passage lies beneath the coracoid process, just under the tendon of pectoralis minor. It is bordered:\n\n-   Superiorly by the coracoid process\n-   Anteriorly by the pectoralis minor muscle\n-   Posteriorly by ribs 2-4 posteriorly.\n\n  \nShortening or tightness of the Pectoralis Major can lead to narrowing of this space, particularly during hyperabduction, resulting in neurovascular compression.\n\n---\n### Anatomical Variants and Contributing Factors\n\nSeveral congenital or acquired **anatomical abnormalities** can further compromise the thoracic outlet, including:\n\n-   The presence of a cervical rib\n-   Congenital soft tissue abnormalities\n-   Long C7 transverse process\n-   Fibrous bands or muscular anomalies (e.g. a broad scalene attachment or hypertrophied scalenes)\n-   Clavicular hypomobility\n-   Scoliosis or elevated scapula\n-   Functionally acquired anatomical changes\n\nSoft tissue abnormalities may create compression or tension loading of the neurovascular structures found within the thoracic outlet (such as hypertrophy, a broader middle scalene attachment on the 1st rib, or fibrous bands that increase stiffness).\n\n---\n#### **Neurological and Entrapment Syndromes**\n\n-   **Cervical radiculopathy** – Nerve root compression causing dermatomal pain, weakness, and sensory changes.\n-   **Nerve root compression (discogenic or spondylotic)** – Often due to disc herniation or degeneration, mimicking neurogenic symptoms.\n-   **Carpal tunnel syndrome** – Median nerve entrapment at the wrist causing numbness in the thumb and fingers.\n-   **Cubital tunnel syndrome** – Ulnar nerve compression at the elbow, resulting in tingling or weakness in the ring and little fingers.\n-   **Radial tunnel syndrome** – Entrapment of the radial nerve causing pain over the lateral forearm.\n-   **Brachial plexus trauma** – Nerve injury from trauma, often acute and with a known mechanism.\n-   **Parsonage-Turner syndrome** – Sudden onset of shoulder pain followed by muscle weakness and wasting.\n-   **Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy** – Late complication of radiotherapy presenting with progressive weakness or sensory loss.\n-   **Complex regional pain syndrome \"Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)\") (CRPS I and II)** – Chronic regional pain with autonomic and sensory abnormalities.\n-   **Sympathetic-mediated pain** – Neuropathic pain due to sympathetic overactivity.\n-   **Thoracic (T4) syndrome** – Upper thoracic dysfunction with diffuse arm pain, paraesthesia, and autonomic symptoms.\n-   **Horner’s syndrome** – Ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis due to sympathetic disruption, sometimes indicating a serious underlying pathology.\n\n---\n#### **Musculoskeletal Disorders**\n\n-   **Rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear** – Shoulder pain and weakness during overhead activity, without neurological signs.\n-   **Glenohumeral joint instability** – Recurrent shoulder subluxation or dislocation, often during movement.\n-   **Shoulder impingement syndrome** – Compression of soft tissues under the acromion during elevation.\n-   **Lateral_Toolkit \"Lateral Epicondyle Tendinopathy (Tennis Elbow) Toolkit\") and medial epicondylitis** – Overuse injuries at the elbow causing localised pain.\n-   **De Quervain’s tenosynovitis** – Pain and swelling near the base of the thumb from tendon inflammation.\n-   **Fibromyalgia** – Widespread pain and tenderness affecting multiple regions, including the neck and shoulders.\n\n---\n#### **Vascular Conditions**\n\n-   **Paget-Schroetter syndrome** – Effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein, often seen in athletes.\n-   **Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT)** – Venous obstruction presenting with swelling, heaviness, and cyanosis.\n-   **Raynaud’s phenomenon** – Vasospasm in fingers triggered by cold or stress, leading to colour changes and numbness.\n-   **Vasculitis** – Inflammatory condition of blood vessels that may mimic vascular TOS.\n-   **Arterial TOS** – Compression of the subclavian artery causing limb ischaemia.\n-   **Other vascular occlusions** – Rare causes of limb ischaemia unrelated to thoracic outlet compression.\n\n---\n#### **Systemic and Red Flag Conditions**\n\n-   **Pancoast tumour (apical lung tumour)** – May compress the lower brachial plexus and present with arm pain and Horner’s syndrome.\n-   **Malignancies compressing the brachial plexus** – Tumours in the neck or thorax producing similar symptoms to neurogenic TOS.\n-   **Cardiac conditions (e.g. angina, referred chest pain)** – May present as upper chest or arm discomfort during exertion.\n-   **Oesophageal disorders** – Can refer pain to the upper chest or neck, mimicking TOS.\n-   **Inflammatory or autoimmune diseases** – Systemic disorders that may affect nerves or vessels and mimic TOS features.",
    "Prognosis": "Most cases demonstrate improvement **within 4-6 weeks** with conservative physical therapy. However, severe vascular compression may necessitate **surgical decompression**. Untreated symptoms can lead to chronic pain and functional impairment.",
    "Treatment Strategy": {
      "Core_Focus": "Rehabilitation is the primary intervention, emphasizing **mobility, postural correction, and strengthening**. **Phase 1: Soft tissue mobilization** and **Postural re-education**. **Phase 2: Neural Mobilization** (**Nerve sliders/glides**) and gentle stretches for the neck and shoulder girdle. **Phase 3: Advanced Neural Tensioners** and **Strengthening Exercises** for the shoulder and neck musculature.

  "Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD)": {
    "Summarizing": "## Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) \n![alt text](https://www.physio-pedia.com/images/4/44/Deep_muscles_of_the_head_and_neck_lateral_aspect_Primal.png)\n\n\nTemporomandibular Disorder (TMD) is a broad term that encompasses disorders of the temporomandibular joint and its associated anatomical structures.\n\nThe disorder may be intra-articular, due to inflammation, internal structural changes (internal derangement) or degeneration, or it may be extra- articular due to imbalance or over-activity of the jaw muscles, commonly the muscles of mastication or the cervical muscles. There is a strong correlation between postural dysfunction of the cervical spine and TMD. There are numerous other conditions that can cause pain in the TMJ region. It is important to make an accurate diagnosis to ensure that the correct treatment is given and that potentially serious problems are not overlooked.\n\n---\n## Causes of TMD\n\n### Intra-Articular Causes\n\n#### **1.** **Inflammatory conditions**\n\nInflammatory conditions within the joint are often caused by direct trauma, such as a blow to the chin or jaw, indirect trauma, such as a whiplash injury, heavy chewing, grinding (bruxism), clenching of the jaw or loss of dental height due to worn down or missing teeth.\n\n-   Synovitis - The synovium or the capsule may be inflamed. There is often pain at rest and limited range of motion or pain at the end of range.\n-   Retrodiscitis - The retrodiscal tissue (the posterior attachment of the articular disc to the mandibular fossa) is highly vascular and innervated and if inflamed, can cause severe pain. The jaw may deviate away from the painful side at rest and with opening.\n\n#### **2\\. Internal derangement**\n\nInternal derangement describes conditions where there are structural changes within the joint. This can be caused by direct trauma, such as a blow to the jaw or falling on the chin, indirect trauma, such as a whiplash injury, long term clenching or grinding, heavy or hard chewing or prolonged periods of mouth opening, such as a dental procedure or a general anaesthetic.\n\n-   Disc displacement with reduction – The articular disc can become displaced in any direction, but will most commonly displace anteriorly. The disc will be pushed forward during opening and will bunch up. At a certain point in range the disc will reposition or reduce itself causing an audible or palpable click. The jaw will often deviate towards the affected side.\n-   Disc displacement without reduction – In this more severe version the disc will not reduce causing pain and a loss of range. This is called closed lock. The jaw will often deviate towards the affected side. There will be no click but the patient may report that there was a click at the time when their jaw locked.\n\n#### **3\\. Arthritis**\n\n-   Degenerative Arthritis can occur in the TMJ. It can often be seen on plain x-ray or Orthopantomagram (OPG) as a flattening of the condylar head, often with some osteophytic formation MRI gives more information with views done in open and closed positions. This shows the position of the joint and disc at the start and end of range. Crepitus can often be felt or can be heard with a stethoscope. It can be age related degeneration, usually seen in the over 50s, or secondary to trauma occurring at a younger age.\n-   Inflammatory Joint Diseases can affect the TMJ, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis \"Ankylosing Spondylitis (Axial Spondyloarthritis)\"), infectious arthritis_Arthritis \"Septic (Infectious) Arthritis\"), Reiter's syndrome and gout.\n\n#### **4\\. Hyper mobility**\n\n-   It can result in excessive anterior movement of the jaw and the articular disc. This will result in deviation of the jaw away from the affected side. There are usually some clicking sounds in the TMJ and there may or may not be pain. Hyper mobility may be related to connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or conditions such as Down Syndrome \"Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)\") and Cerebral Palsy. Long term hyper mobility can cause the articular disc to elongate and degenerate. The disc can then fail to reduce on closing, causing the TMJ to become stuck in an open position (Open Lock). This can often occur after opening the mouth to an extreme position, such as when singing or yawning or after a prolonged dental procedure.\n\n### Extra-Articular Causes\n\n#### **1\\. Muscle Spasm**\n\nMuscle Spasm can cause significant pain and limitation of movement of the jaw. This is referred to as trismus. It often affects one or more muscles, commonly the muscles of mastication, especially masseter, temporalis and the pterygoid muscles. Causes include prolonged dental procedures or anaesthetics where the mouth has been held open for extended periods of time, stress, bruxism and postural dysfunction.\n\n#### **2\\. Cervical Postural Disorders**\n\nCervical postural disorders can cause jaw pain. The anterior belly of the digastric muscle runs from the point of the chin to hyoid bone. This attachment means that when the head is protracted forward digastric will exert a posterior force on the mandible. With prolonged cervical protraction as occurs with poor posture or stress-related posture the mandibular condyle is pushed back against the retrodiscal tissue, eventually causing swelling, pain and gradual degeneration of the disc.\n\n#### **3\\. Temporal Tendinopathy**\n\nTemporal tendinopathy is caused by excessive contraction of the temporalis muscle usually as a result of bruxism. There is tenderness and swelling of the anterior portion of the temporalis tendon palpable just above the zygomatic arch. There may also be tenderness of the temporalis tendon where it inserts onto the coronoid process, palpable just below the zygomatic arch when the jaw is slightly open.\n\n#### **4\\. Fractures**\n\nFractures of the mandible often occur at the mandibular symphysis or the condylar neck. Commonly there will be a fracture of the mandibular symphysis combined with a fracture/dislocation of one or both condyles. The mechanism of injury can be a blow to the jaw or a fall onto the chin. Treatment can usually begin within a week or two of surgery to begin early mobilisation of the TMJ and to restore function.",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) varies, with many cases improving on their own or with conservative treatment, while others can become chronic and challenging to manage. Around one-third of patients experience complete pain resolution, another third have continuous pain, and the last third have recurrent symptoms over several years. Factors influencing prognosis include genetics, psychosocial stress, and pain perception. Early diagnosis and conservative treatments like self-care, physical therapy, and oral appliances are often effective.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "TMD is a recurring, but self limiting condition that tends not to be progressive. Non-invasive, conservative treatments have found to be effective. Physiotherapy treatment is very effective in relieving and managing TMD, even when the symptoms are long-standing and severe. With appropriate physiotherapy most patients will see a significant improvement in their symptoms within 3 to 6 weeks.  \nTreatment needs to address the issues identified in the assessment.\n\n-   If the patient’s symptoms are acute and inflammatory then their condition is likely to be irritable and one should proceed very gently with the aim of first relieving pain, swelling and muscle spasm.  When the pain begins to settle then start to restore jaw movement and alignment. Treatment may include soft tissue releases to affected muscles and joint mobilisation techniques.\n-   It is also important to treat any associated neck pain and headaches.  Posture correction is essential and should address head, neck, shoulder and tongue position. The patient should be taught exercises to improve coordination, stability and alignment of the jaw.\n-   If the patient has signs of sleep bruxism then should discuss with their dentist whether and occlusal splint would be appropriate for them. Occlusal splints hold the TMJ slightly apart as the patient clenches or grinds, preventing compression of the TMJ. This can help to relax jaw muscles and reduce swelling and inflammation. There is some evidence to supporting the use of splints to reduce long term degeneration of the TMJ, disc and teeth.  \n-   Other dental problems, such as cavities, that are causing pain or uneven chewing, lack of dental height or missing teeth may also need to be addressed.\n-   The patient should be taught strategies to help them manage their condition. This may include posture education, long-term continuance of their home exercise programme, good sleep habits including sleeping positions, stress management and diet modification - a soft food diet while the condition is acute can help to reduce the pain and swelling more quickly. The patient should also be taught ways to reduce stress on the TMJ by avoiding activities such as resting the chin on the hand, pencil chewing, jaw clenching while awake, wide mouth yawning, nail biting. They should avoid chewy foods, chewing gum, eating foods that need a wide opening like large hamburgers and chewing hard foods such as nuts and apples. Case report[\\[9\\]]( suggests early post-operative exercises after temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis in pediatric patients along with a stringent follow-up to prevent post-operative shrinkage and adhesions.\n\n---\n## Manual Therapy\n\nA systematic review was published in 2015 to summarize the effectiveness of manual therapy on signs and symptoms of TMD. It showed that protocols of mixed manual therapy techniques, upper cervical mobilization or manipulation, had considerable evidence for TMD symptom control and improvement in maximum mouth opening. The manual techniques included intra-oral myofascial release and massage therapy on masticatory muscles, atlanto-occipital joint thrust manipulation, and upper cervical spine mobilization\n\nTherapists should be trained, follow the guidelines and standard procedures to perform the cervical thrust manipulation if it is indicated.\n\nThe results of the recent clinical trial indicate that both methods, the _post-isometric muscle relaxation_ and _myofacial release_ can be used as effective forms of supportive therapy in the prosthetic treatment of pain-related TMD, accompanied by increased masticatory muscle tension.",

  "Bicep Tendinopathy": {
    "Summarizing": "## Practice Essentials\n\nBicipital tendinitis, or biceps tendinitis, is an inflammatory process of the long head of the biceps tendon and is a common cause of shoulder pain due to its position and function.   The tendon is exposed on the anterior shoulder as it passes through the humeral bicipital groove and inserts onto the superior aspect of the labrum of the glenohumeral joint. (See the image below.) Disorders of the biceps tendon can result from impingement or as an isolated inflammatory injury. Other causes are secondary to compensation for rotator cuff disorders, labral tears, and intra-articular pathology.\n\n---\n### Signs and symptoms\n\nPatients typically report achy anterior shoulder pain, which is exacerbated by lifting or elevated pushing or pulling. A frequent complaint is pain with overhead activity or with lifting heavy objects.\n\n---",
    "Prognosis": "Although the prognosis of bicipital tendinitis is dependent upon the degree of injury, most patients do well with treatment. However, a significant number of patients develop degenerative changes, and spontaneous rupture of the biceps tendon occurs in 10% of patients.\n\n### Complications\n\nIndividuals who return to a high level of athletic activity too soon may find themselves with symptom flare-ups. Continued straining of an injury that has not healed completely can put the individual at risk for chronic degenerative tissue damage and biceps tendon rupture.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "## Acute Phase\n\n### Rehabilitation Program\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nThe initial goals of the acute phase of treatment for bicipital tendinitis are to reduce inflammation and swelling. Patients should restrict over-the-shoulder movements, reaching, and lifting.\n\nPatients should apply ice to the affected area for 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times per day for the first 48 hours. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are used for 3-4 weeks to treat inflammation and pain. The degree of immobilization depends upon the degree of the injury and the patient's discomfort. Most authors agree that prolonged immobilization tends to result in a stiff shoulder.\n\nPhysical therapy plays a minor role in the treatment of acute bicipital tendinitis; however, some authors recommend daily weighted, pendulum stretch exercises for uncomplicated and mild cases of acute bicipital tendinitis. Use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been reported with some success.\n\nPhonophoresis and iontophoresis are examples of methods that are used to deliver steroids into inflamed tissue without an injection. Phonophoresis uses ultrasound, whereas iontophoresis uses electrical repulsion to transport medicines through the skin. In order to deliver an effective steroid concentration, the target area should be superficial, and serial application is necessary.\n\n### Medical Issues/Complications\n\nIt is important to realize that performing analgesic and steroid injections into the bicipital groove is not without risk. Use care to avoid direct injection into the long head of the biceps tendon itself because this can result in direct trauma to — and may lead to atrophy and/or rupture of — the tendon. Other complications from injections include postinjection infection and inflammatory reaction. In order to exclude a possible missed differential diagnosis, radiographic imaging should be considered if no improvement occurs after treatment.\n\n### Consultations\n\nConsider orthopedic consultation if the patient's symptoms persist longer than 2 months or if biceps tendon rupture occurs.\n\n### Other Treatment\n\nA local injection of an anesthetic and steroid can be given in the bicipital groove. A combination of 2-3 mL of anesthetic with 1 mL of methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) is typically recommended 3-6 weeks after the acute injury. A repeat injection can be performed 4 weeks later if the symptoms have not decreased by 50%. Caution is indicated with additional injections or with patients older than 40 years because there is an increased risk of biceps tendon rupture from repetitive injections. Restrict lifting and overhead activities by the patient for 30 days after the injection.\n\n---\n\n\n## Recovery Phase\n\n### Rehabilitation Program\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nPhysical therapy and rehabilitation are directed toward restoring the integrity and strength of the dynamic and static stabilizers of the shoulder joint while restoring the affected shoulder's ROM, which is critical for most athletes.\n\nThe goal of the recovery phase is to achieve and maintain full and painless ROM. Weighted, pendulum stretch exercises are combined with isometric toning. These exercises are recommended 3 times per week throughout the recovery phase. Passive stretching with ROM exercises removes residual shoulder stiffness. The uninvolved shoulder can be used as a standard comparison to achieve symmetric ROM.\n\n**Occupational Therapy**\n\nAlthough a rehabilitation program should improve strength and flexibility, adding an interval program can help restore normal joint arthrokinematics. Interval tennis and baseball programs have been developed for highly competitive athletes as these individuals recover from bicipital tendinitis. The patient progresses in a series of steps and stages, with the goal of returning safely to competition without reinjury. The progression of therapy is dependent upon a gradual, painless increase in activity without excessive fatigue.\n\n### Medical Issues/Complications\n\nFailure to recognize concomitant injuries with bicipital tendinitis could result in delayed healing and damage from inappropriate treatment. Physical therapy for shoulder injuries or a misdiagnosed injury may aggravate other conditions in the elbow and neck.\n\n### Consultations\n\nConsider orthopedic consultation if the patient's symptoms persist longer than 2 months or if biceps tendon rupture occurs.\n\n### Other Treatment (Injection, manipulation, etc.)\n\nWeighted, pendulum swings should begin with moist heat application to the shoulder on the affected side, followed by therapy with 5- to 10-lb weights, which are held lightly in the hand. The shoulder muscle should be relaxed and the arm kept vertical and close to the body. The arm is allowed to swing back and forth, no greater than 1 inch in any direction. Note: This exercise is not appropriate for patients who have shoulder separation or strain, upper back strain, or neck strain.\n\n---\n\n\n## Maintenance Phase\n\n### Rehabilitation Program\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nThe maintenance phase concentrates on the patient developing increased strength and endurance on the affected side. This phase can begin as soon as patient discomfort is effectively controlled and should continue for at least 3 weeks after the pain has completely resolved. When performing strengthening exercises, it is safer for the individual to start out with low tension, followed by a gradual increase in force, because flare-ups can occur.\n\nThe patient continues isotonic and isokinetic stretching and is allowed limited participation in sports activities. Monitor the patient and adjust his/her activities as progress allows. Note: Conditioning and proper throwing techniques are important for certain athletes because improper mechanics may result in tissue fatigue and damage.\n\n### Surgical Intervention\n\nSurgical intervention is not recommended for bicipital tendinitis if the patient is making a slow and gradual improvement. Surgical treatment is only indicated after a 6-month trial of conservative care is unsuccessful. Although good results have been reported with arthroscopic decompression, acromioplasty with anterior acromionectomy is the standard surgical treatment for bicipital tendinitis. The biceps tendon does not generally undergo tenodesis unless severe attritional wear or eminent rupture is found. No attempt is made to repair biceps tendon ruptures older than 6 weeks.\n\nTenodesis is not recommended when it is believed that the tendinitis is reversible. Specific indications for tenodesis of the biceps long head include the following:\n\n-   Greater than 25% partial-thickness biceps tendon tear\n    \n-   Severe subluxation from the bicipital groove\n    \n-   Disruption of the associated bony or ligamentous anatomy of the groove itself\n    \n-   Biceps tendon atrophy greater than 25%\n    \n-   Failure of surgical decompression\n    \n\nGrowing evidence has shown a shift from routine tenodesis to a more individual approach, with considerations such as physiologic age, activity level, expectations, and specific combinations of shoulder pathology as important factors. Although new repair techniques continue to be developed, the preference is for preservation of the biceps-labral complex rather than routine surgery. When surgery is performed for bicipital tendinitis, the procedure is typically performed through an open anterior incision. Variations of this surgery include arthroscopic techniques and open exposures with suture anchors through the subclavian portal. Subpectoral biceps tenodesis has proven to be an effective procedure to relieve pain and maintain function.\n\n### Consultations\n\nConsider orthopedic consultation if the patient's symptoms persist longer than 2 months or if biceps tendon rupture occurs.\n\n---\n\n\n### Return to play\n\nReturn to activity should not occur until the patient's discomfort and pain is controlled effectively and a monitoring program has been initiated. Some authors recommend waiting 3 weeks after pain has completely resolved before allowing participation in competitive activities.\n\n---\n\n\n## Prevention\n\nPrevention of bicipital tendinitis is similar to prevention of rotator cuff injuries, including warm-ups before exercise, the use of passive stretching and strengthening exercises, avoidance of painful activities, and the use of proper biomechanics. Increased attention should be made for those athletes at high risk of bicipital tendinitis, such as baseball pitchers. High angular velocity and torques combined with the repetitious nature of pitching results in vulnerability of the shoulder to injury.",

  "Frozen Shoulder": {
    "Summarizing": "## Practice Essentials\n\nAdhesive capsulitis and frozen shoulder syndrome (FSS) are two terms that have been used to describe a painful and stiff shoulder. The current consensus definition of a frozen shoulder by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons is \"a condition of uncertain etiology characterized by significant restriction of both active and passive shoulder motion that occurs in the absence of a known intrinsic shoulder disorder. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons defines this condition as: \"A condition of varying severity characterized by the gradual development of global limitation of active and passive shoulder motion where radiographic findings other than osteopenia are absent.\"\n\nThe loss of passive range of motion (ROM) is a critical element in establishing the diagnosis of a true frozen shoulder. Although conditions such as subacromial bursitis and partial rotator cuff tears can be associated with significant pain and loss of active ROM, passive ROM is preserved. Therefore, patients with those conditions should not be classified as having a frozen shoulder.\n\nLundberg divided patients who met the pain and motion requirements of frozen shoulder into two groups: primary and secondary. A patient meets the criteria of primary or secondary FSS if painful, restricted active and passive glenohumeral and scapulothoracic motion occurs for at least 1 month and has either reached a plateau or worsened. This inclusion period for defining frozen shoulder is similar to that described by Binder and colleagues but is shorter than that defined by Lloyd-Roberts and coworkers.\n\nPatients with primary frozen shoulder have no significant findings in the history, clinical examination, or radiographic evaluation to explain their motion loss and pain. Classically, symptoms of primary frozen shoulder have been divided into three phases: freezing (painful), frozen (stiffening), and thawing.\n\nThe initial painful phase is marked by a gradual onset of diffuse shoulder pain lasting from weeks to months. The stiffening phase is characterized by a progressive loss of ROM that may last up to 1 year. Most patients lose glenohumeral external rotation, internal rotation, and abduction during this phase. The final, thawing phase is measured in weeks to months and constitutes a period of gradual motion improvement. Once in this phase, the patient may require up to 9 months to regain a functional ROM.\nPatients with diabetes and younger patients may be more likely to develop contralateral idiopathic adhesive capsulitis.\n\nIn contrast to patients with primary FSS, patients with secondary FSS describe an event that preceded the onset of shoulder symptoms, such as the following:\n\n-   Upper extremity trauma (eg, shoulder surgery, rotator cuff tear, proximal humerus facture)\n-   Immobilization (eg, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery)\n-   Metabolic/endocrine (eg, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, hyperlipidemia)\n-   Neurologic (eg, stroke, Parkinson disease)\n-   Cardiac disease (eg, ischemic heart disease, hypertension)\n-   Drugs (eg, protease inhibitors, antiretrovirals, immunizations, fluoroquinolones)\n-   Malignancy\n    \nIn most patients, FSS will resolve completely with nonsurgical management, which includes physiotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injection. For patients who have minimal improvement after three months of conservative therapy, surgical options include manipulation under anesthesia and arthroscopic capsule release.\n\n---\n\n\n## Problem\n\nCodman originally coined the term frozen shoulder to describe a condition with the following signs and symptoms:\n\n-   Slow-onset shoulder pain\n-   Localized discomfort near the deltoid insertion\n-   Inability to sleep on the affected side\n-   Restricted glenohumeral elevation and external rotation\n-   A normal radiologic appearance\n    \nThe inclusion criteria for FSS include painful restriction of active and passive glenohumeral and/or periscapular motion.\n\nDespite these criteria, diagnosing FSS can be controversial because there is little consensus on the specific shoulder motion restrictions or duration of symptoms needed to qualify a patient as having a frozen shoulder. Although various authors have classified patients with FSS as those with limited abduction from 45-135º, FSS is still primarily a clinical diagnosis based on clinical motion loss and symptoms.\n\n---\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nFrozen shoulder syndrome (FSS) usually affects patients aged 40-60 years. The incidence of FSS is not precisely known; however, it is estimated that 2% to 5% of the general population develops the disease over their lifetime. Women tend to be affected more often than men, and there is no predilection for race. In general, bilateral shoulder involvement is rarely simultaneous and instead occurs sequentially.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for FSS. A meta-analysis by Zreik concluded that diabetic patients are 5 times more likely to develop adhesive capsulitis compared with non-diabetic controls. They reported a 13.4% overall mean prevalence of adhesive capsulitis in patients with diabetes, and a 30% mean prevalence of diabetes in a population with adhesive capsulitis. Zreik found no significant difference in the prevalence of the disorder with type 1 versus type 2 diabetes, or between patients on insulin therapy and those on oral hypoglycemic agents. \n\nThyroid disease has also been linked to FSS. A meta-analysis by Chuang et al found significantly higher rates of hypothyroidism (odds ratio \\[OR\\] = 1.92, _P_ \\= 0.02) and subclinical hypothyroidism (OR = 2.56, _P_ < 0.00001) in patients with FSS than in those without FSS.  A nationwide longitudinal population-based study from Taiwan concluded that hyperthyroidism is an independent risk factor for FSS.\n\n---\n## Contraindications\n\nContraindications to surgical intervention for recalcitrant frozen shoulder include the following:\n\n-   Concomitant neurologic complaints or abnormalities originating from the cervical spine\n-   An inadequate trial of conservative therapy (< 3 mo)\n-   Ongoing infection of any type\n-   Isolated capsular release in the face of adhesive capsulitis and concomitant glenohumeral arthritis (in this situation, capsular release or lengthening should be performed in conjunction with total shoulder arthroplasty)\n-   An ongoing oncologic process involving the affected shoulder\n    \n---\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nImmune, inflammatory and fibrotic changes appear to be involved in the pathophysiology of FSS. The current hypothesis posits inflammation in the joint capsule  followed by development of adhesions and fibrosis of the synovial lining. Thickening and contraction of the glenohumeral joint capsule and formation of collagenous tissue surrounding the joint reduces joint volume. \n\nBiomarkers in synovial fluid suggest chronic inflammation is present. The following markers have been identified in FSS:\n\n-   Intercellular adhesion molecule–1 (ICAM-1; CD54)\n-   Transforming growth factor–beta (TGF-β)\n-   Tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-α)\n-   Interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and beta\n-   IL-6\n-   Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)\n    \nMatrix metalloproteinases are involved in the construction of extracellular matrix and in the various cytokines that control collagen deposition. Drugs that inhibit matrix metalloproteinase can induce conditions very similar to FSS and Dupuytren disease.\n\nFollowing the synovial inflammatory process, a high number of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts suggest a fibrotic process in the capsule. The condition is thought to result from progressive fibrosis and eventual contracture of the capsule of the glenohumeral joint, which causes pain and stiffness.\n\nMicrovascular diseases such as diabetes mellitus may cause abnormal collagen repair, which predisposes patients to FSS. Increased glycosylation of collagen protein and increased formation of abnormal glycation end products and their subsequent accumulation have a detrimental effect on cellular and extracellular processes that might facilitate adhesion and fibrosis. Neovascularization with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) staining has also been identified in diabetic tissue samples.",
    "Prognosis": "FSS has a favorable natural history. It is generally a self-limiting condition that can be treated with physical therapy and typically resolves in 1-3 years. Time to recovery does not differ between primary and secondary FSS. No difference in pain and disability of FSS in patients with and without diabetes has been reported. Patients with FSS do not have a lower shoulder activity level than sex- and age-matched controls.\n\nHowever, several studies have demonstrated long-term pain and shoulder stiffness following conservative treatment. Long-term disability has been reported in 15%,  permanent functional loss in 7-15%, and persistent symptoms in 40%. \n\nSeveral studies have noted improved symptoms following arthroscopic capsular release, as follows:\n\n-   Warner and colleagues reported an improvement in the Constant and Murley score of 48 points with a mean follow-up of 39 months.\n-   Pearsall and colleagues found that 83% of patients reported their shoulder to be normal or near normal at an average of 22 months following capsular release. \n-   Ogilvie-Harris noted that 15 of 18 patients treated with arthroscopic capsular release had an excellent result at 2-5 years following surgery.\n-   A review of the literature indicates that in patients with refractory adhesive capsulitis, a near-excellent to excellent result in 75-90% of cases can be expected in patients treated with arthroscopic capsular release and an aggressive postoperative physical therapy regimen.",

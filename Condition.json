  "Neck Strains & Sprains (Whiplash)": {
    "Summarizing": "**Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD)** describe injuries from sudden acceleration-deceleration movements, most commonly from motor vehicle accidents. The term 'whiplash' refers to the injury mechanism, while WAD encompasses the resulting symptoms including:\n- pain\n- stiffness\n- muscle spasm\n-  headache.\n---\n# Clinically Relevant Anatomy\nWhiplash and whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) affect a variety of anatomical structures of the cervical spine, depending on the force and direction of impact as well as many other factors. Causes of pain can be any of these tissues, with the strain injury resulting in secondary oedema, haemorrhage, and inflammation:\n\n1. **joints**: zygapophyseal joints, Atlanto-axial joint, Atlanto-occipital joint\n1. intervertebral discs and cartilaginous endplates\n1. muscles\n1. **ligaments**: Alar ligament, Anterior atlanto-axial ligament, Anterior atlanto-occipital ligament, Apical ligament, Anterior longitudinal ligament, Transverse ligament of the atlas\n1.  **bones**: Atlas, Axis, vertebrae (C3-C7)\n1. **nervous systems structures**: nerve roots, spinal cord, brain, sympathetic nervous system\n1. **the vascular system structures**: internal carotid and vertebral artery\n1. **adjacent joints**: Temporomandibular joint, thoracic spine, ribs, shoulder complex\n1. the peripheral vestibular system\n---\n# Pathology\n\n***Most WADs are considered to be minor soft tissue-based injuries without evidence of fracture.*** \n\nThe injury occurs in three stages: \n\n- **Stage 1** involves flexion of upper and lower cervical spines.\n- **Stage 2** shows the cervical spine extending into an S-shape, eventually straightening and restoring its lordotic curve. The cervical spine forms an abnormal S-shaped curve, with simultaneous hyperextension of the lower cervical segments and flexion of the upper segments, exceeding normal physiological limits.\n- **Stage 3** is characterized by complete spinal extension, causing significant shearing forces that compress the facet joint capsules.\n\nThe Quebec Task Force classifies patients with WAD (whiplash), based on the severity of signs and symptoms, as follows: \n\n- **Grade 1** the patient complains of neck pain, stiffness, or tenderness with no positive findings on physical exam. \n- **Grade 2** the patient exhibits musculoskeletal signs including decreased range of motion and point tenderness.   \n- **Grade 3** the patient also shows neurologic signs that may include sensory deficits, decreased deep tendon reflexes, muscle weakness.\n- **Grade 4** the patient shows a fracture\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\n*Whiplash can be an acute or chronic disorder. In acute whiplash, symptoms last no more than 2-3 months, while in chronic whiplash symptoms last longer than three months. Patients with acute WAD experience widespread pressure hypersensitivity and reduced cervical mobility.  Various studies indicate that there can be a spontaneous recovery within 2-3 months.*\n\n*Whiplash-associated disorder is a complex condition with varied disturbances in motor, sensorimotor, and sensory functions and psychological distress. It is important to carry out thorough spinal and neurological examinations in patients with WAD to screen for delayed onset of the cervical spine instability or myelopathy. The most common symptoms are sub-occipital headache which appears or increases within seven days after the injury.*\n\n**Primary Motor Features**\n\n- Restricted range of motion of the cervical spine\n- Altered patterns of muscle recruitment in both the cervical spine and shoulder girdle regions (clearly a feature of chronic WAD)\n- Mechanical cervical spine instability\n\n**Sensorimotor Features (Greater in patients who also report dizziness due to the neck pain)**\n- Loss of balance\n- Disturbed neck influenced eye movement control\n\n**Sensory and Psychological Features**\n\n- Psychological distress\n- Post-traumatic stress\n- Concentration and memory problems\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Anxiety\n> - Post traumatic stress and anxiety are more common in women (19.7% and 11.7%, respectively) compared to men (13.2% and 8.6%)\n- Depression\n>-  Initial depression: associated with greater neck and low back pain severity, numbness/tingling in arms/hands, vision problems, dizziness, fracture\n> - Persistent depression: associated with older age, greater initial neck and low back pain, post-crash dizziness, anxiety, numbness/tingling, vision and hearing problems\n> - Depression may be present in around 5% in women and men\n\n**Muscular Changes**\n\n- Neck stiffness\n- Fatty infiltrate may be present in the deep muscles in the suboccipital region and the multifidi may account for some of the functional impairments such as: Proprioceptive deficits, Balance loss, Disturbed motor control of the neck\n\n**Associated Symptoms**\n\nThe following symptoms may also occur:\n\n- Tinnitus\n- Malaise\n- Disequilibrium/Dizziness\n- Thoracic, temporomandibular, facial, and limb pain\n---\n# Differential Diagnosis\n- Cervical spine fracture\n- Carotid artery dissection\n- Herniated disc\n- Spinal cord injury\n- Subluxation of the cervical spine\n- Muscle strain\n- Facet injury\n- Ligamentous injury",
    "Prognosis": "**The prognosis of WAD is unknown and unpredictable**\n- some cases remain acute with a full recovery.\n- while some progress to chronic with long term pain and disability.\n\n*Early intervention recommendations are:*\n- rest\n- pain relief\n- basic stretching and stretching exercises.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "# Acute Whiplash\nEducation provided by physiotherapists or general practitioners is important in preventing chronic WAD and must be part of the biopsychosocial approach for whiplash patients. The most important goals of the interventions are:\n\n1. Reassuring the patient\n1. Modulating maladaptive cognition about WAD\n1. Activating the patient\n- The target of education is removing therapy barriers, enhancing therapy compliance and preventing and treating chronicity.\n- For acute WAD verbal education and written advice are helpful (evidence exists that oral information is equally as efficient as an active exercise program).\n- A multidisciplinary programme is best for subacute/chronic patients, with a programme integrating information, exercises and behavioural programmes.\n\nDifferent types of education include:\n1. **Oral Education:** Provide oral education concerning the whiplash mechanisms and emphasising physical activity and correct posture. It has a better effect on pain, cervical mobility, and recovery, compared to rest and neck collars. Oral education could be as effective as active physiotherapy and mobilisation.\n1. **Educational video:** A brief psycho-educational video shown at the patient's bedside seems to have a profound effect on subsequent pain and medical utilisation in acute whiplash patients, compared to the usual care.\n\nEducation and information given to the patient must contain the following information:\n\n- Reassurance that prognosis following a whiplash injury is good.\n- Encouragement to return to normal activities as soon as possible using exercises to facilitate recovery\nReassurance that pain is normal following a whiplash injury and that patients should use analgesia consistently to control this\n- Advice against using a soft collar as exercises and/or advice to stay active has shown more favourable outcomes on pain and disability\n\nDifferent types of exercise can be considered for WAD:\n\n- ROM exercises\n- McKenzie exercises\n- Postural exercises\n- Strengthening\n- Motor control exercises.\n---\n# Chronic Whiplash\n- Chronic WAD results from a combination of the injury with psychological factors.\n- Chronic WAD patients report worse health than people with non-specific chronic neck pain.\n- A multidisciplinary therapy with cognitive, behavioural therapy and physical therapy, including neck exercises is applied in management of Chronic WAD patients. It also gives positive results according to the reductions of neck pain and sick leave.\n- Behavioural therapy is used in the therapy as it decreases the patient’s pain intensity in problematic daily activities. ie adapt planning and treatment.\n- Exercise programs have a positive result in reducing pain in the short term. Exercise programmes are the most effective noninvasive treatment for patients with chronic WAD and coordination exercises should be added to the treatment to reduce neck pain.\n- In patients with chronic WAD, negative thoughts are a very important factor. Negative thoughts and pain behaviour can be influenced by specialists and physical therapists by educating patients with chronic WAD on the neurophysiology of pain.\n- Simple advice is equally as effective as a more intense and comprehensive physiotherapy exercise programme."

  "Cervical Spondylosis (Arthritis)": {
    "Summarizing": "**Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD)** of the cervical spine, common with advancing age. It results from **age-related degenerative changes** of the intervertebral discs and facet joints, leading to **osteophyte formation** (bone spurs). While often asymptomatic, it can manifest as **cervicalgia**, **stiffness**, and **reduced CROM**. Diagnosis is typically confirmed via **medical imaging** following symptom onset. Symptoms include: **Cervicalgia** (potentially radiating to the shoulders), **Cervical muscle stiffness**, **Reduced CROM**, and **Muscular tenderness**.",
    "Prognosis": "While the underlying **degenerative changes are irreversible**, associated pain and functional limitations can significantly improve **within 4-6 weeks** with focused rehabilitation. Symptoms can become chronic if unaddressed.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "Management focuses on **Rehabilitation**, utilizing manual therapy, mobility exercises, and resistance training. **Phase 1: Gentle Soft Tissue Mobilization** of the neck, scapula, and thoracic regions for analgesia. **Phase 2: Stretching** of the neck and scapular muscles, **Cervical Mobility drills**, and **Cervical Isometrics**. **Phase 3: Resistance Training** to enhance cervical muscle strength and provide **long-term pain control** and stability. Note: Persistent pain **beyond 12 weeks** necessitates further specialist evaluation, potentially including image-guided injections."

  "Cervicogenic Headache": {
    "Summarizing": "**Cervicogenic headache (CGH):** is a chronic headache that arises from the *atlanto-occipital* and *upper cervical joints* and perceived in one or more regions of the head and/or face.\n\n**A cervicogenic headache** is a common cause of a *chronic headache that is often misdiagnosed*. The presenting features can be complex and similar to many primary headache syndromes that are encountered daily. \n\n\nThe main symptoms of a cervicogenic headache are a combination of:\n1. unilateral pain\n1. ipsilateral diffuse shoulder\n1. arm pain. \n\nROM in the neck is reduced, and pain is relieved with anesthetic blockades.\n\n---\n\n#  Clinical Relevant Anatomy\n\nThe cervical spine consists of 7 vertebrae, C1 to C7, the cervical nerves from C1 to C8, muscles and ligaments, The first two vertebrae have a unique shape and function.They form the upper cervical spine.\n\n\n- The upper vertebrae supports the skull (atlas/C1), articulates superiorly with the occiput (the atlanto-occipital joint) . This joint is responsible for 33% of flexion and extension.The design of the atlas allows forward and backward movement of the head.\n- Below the atlas is the axis (C2) that allows rotation.The atlantoaxial joint is responsible for 60% of all cervical rotation.\n- The 5 cervical vertebrae that make up the lower cervical spine, C3-C7, are similar to each other but very different from C1 and C2.\n\n---\n# Pathophysiology\n- The C1-C3 nerves relay pain signals to the nociceptive nucleus of the head and neck, the trigeminocervical nucleus. This connection is thought to be the cause for referred pain to the occiput and/or eyes.\n- Aseptic inflammation and neurotransmission within the C-fibers that is caused by cervical disc pathology is thought to produce and worsen the pain in a cervicogenic headache.\n- The trigeminocervical nucleus receives afferents from the trigeminal nerve as well as the upper three cervical spinal nerves. Neck trauma, whiplash, strain, or chronic spasm of the scalp, neck, or shoulder muscles can increase the sensitivity of the area which is similar to the allodynia that is seen in late chronic migraines.\n- A lower pain threshold makes patients more susceptible to more severe pain. For this reason, early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention is very important.\n\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\nChallenging to diagnose clinically, but often includes the below:\n- Unilateral “ram’s horn” or unilateral dominant headache (Excluding those with bilateral headache or symptoms that typify migraine headaches).\n- Exacerbated by neck movement or posture\n- Tenderness of the upper 3 cervical spine joints\n- Association with neck pain or dysfunction\n- Definitive diagnosis made through selective nerve blocking through injection of specific sites\n- Compared to migraine headache and control groups, cervicogenic headache group patients tend to have increased tightness and trigger points in upper trapezius, levator scapulae, scalenes and suboccipital extensors\n- Weakness in the deep neck flexors\n- Increased activity in the superficial flexors\n- Atrophy in the suboccipital extensors and so the deep muscle sleeve which is important for active support of the cervical segments becomes impaired\n- Upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, levator scapulae, pectoralis major and minor, and short sub-occipital extensors have been implicated\n\n---\n# Differential Diagnosis\nIt is important to differentiate from serious pathology such as:\n- Vascular Pathologies of the Neck\n- Intracranial Pathology\n- Cervical Instability\n- Cervical Myelopathy\n- Occipital neuralgia\n---\n# Red Flags\n1. Sudden onset of a new severe headache.\n1. A worsening pattern of a pre-existing headache in the absence of obvious predisposing factors.\n1. Headache associated with fever, neck stiff ness, skin rash, and with a history of cancer, HIV, or other systemic illness.\n1. Headache associated with focal neurologic signs other than typical aura.\n1. Moderate or severe headache triggered by cough, exertion, or bearing down.\n1. New onset of a headache during or following pregnancy.\n\n***Patients with one or more red flags should be referred for an immediate medical consultation and further investigation.***",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for a **cervicogenic headache** varies from person to person, with mild cases sometimes resolving on their own, while more severe or chronic cases require professional treatment and may recur.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "***Although this type of headache is responsive to therapy oriented at treating the soft tissue restrictions, the method of examination, assessment, and treatment needs to be specific to the neck and occiput.*** \n\n\n---\n\n\n# Treatment\n- Cervical spine manipulation or mobilization\n- Strengthening exercises including deep neck flexors and upper quarter muscles\n- Thoracic spine thrust manipulation & exercise\n- C1-C2 Self-sustained Natural Apophyseal Glide (SNAG) shown to be effective for reducing cervicogenic headache symptoms\n\n**Jull et al** reported that a *six week* physiotherapy program including manual therapy and exercise interventions was an effective treatment option for reduction of cervicogenic headache symptoms and decreasing medication intake in both the short term and at one-year follow-up. \n\nAccording to the **Delphi study (2021)** conducted to get consensus on physiotherapy treatment in headaches, active mobilisation exercises, upper cervical spine mobilisations, passive mobilisation with movement, work-related ergonomic training, and active mobilisation with movement can be used in the treatment of Cervicogenic headaches."

  "General Neck Pain & Stiffness": {
    "Summarizing": "**Neck pain** is characterised by its sudden onset, typically lasting *less than three months*. \n\nThis discomfort can manifest as localised pain or radiate to the:\n- head\n- shoulders\n- arms\n\nVarious factors such as injury, disease, wear and tear, or poor biomechanics can stress the spine and lead to this type of pain. **However**, pinpointing the exact source of discomfort can be challenging. \n\nPotential contributing factors may include:\n- nerve damage\n- tissue scarring\n- arthritis\n- emotional effects of pain.\n\n\n---\n# Functional Anatomy\nThe cervical spine consists of several structural group:\n\n**Muscles:**\n\n- anterior muscles\n- posterior muscles\n- lateral muscles\n- muscles that feed into the neck\n\n**Ligaments :**\n \n- anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament\n- intertransverse ligaments\n- nucheal ligament\n- alar ligaments\n- apical ligaments of dens\n- yellow ligaments\n\n**Neurological structures:** \n- arteries\n- nerves\n- glands\n- 2 passageways\n\n---\n# Mechanism of injury and Differential Diagnosis\n\nUnderstanding the mechanism of acute neck pain and differential diagnosis are the key parts of a physiotherapy assessment process. Various sources can contribute to acute neck pain:\n\n- **Cervical muscle sprain** (Most common cause of acute neck pain, usually caused my overuse of the musculature e.g., sitting hunched over in a chair)\n- **Muscle weakness** (Training muscles asymmetrically can cause pain i.e., training upper traps more than lower traps can lead to overstimulation of the upper traps, the difference can cause pain)\n- **Concussion** (After a concussion, people may experience head and neck pain, it can start quickly after and last anywhere from a few days to months/years.) *Any symptoms that last longer than 3 months after is considered post-concussion syndrome*\n- **RTA** (Symptoms can occur suddenly or within a few days following an accident , similar to a concussion, how long the symptoms last can range)\n- **Whiplash** (This can occur within a RTA or from another type of trauma e.g., a fall)\n---\n# Risk Factors\n\nIdentifying and understanding risk factors is crucial for prevention and early diagnosis, as acute neck pain can potentially evolve into chronic conditions. Potential contributing risk factors include:\n\n1. Advanced age\n1. Female\n1. History of neck, shoulder, and pelvis trauma\n1. Psychological factors\n1. Lifestyle\n---\n# Classification\n\nAccording to the updated neck pain revision of the **Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA)** in 2017, these are the revised clinical guidelines for neck pain classification:\n\n- Neck pain with mobility deficits\n- Neck pain with movement coordination impairments\n- Neck pain with headaches\n- Neck pain with radiating pain\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\nEvery acute neck pain present differently, it often present with more than a simple pain in the neck. Typically, it is accompanied by:\n\n- Referred pain (headache, shoulder pain, upper or lower back pain, radiated pain with upper extremity numbness.) These pain can be explained by refereed or widespread pain from innervated cervical spine structure.\n- Mobility deficit (reduce range of motion)\n- Coordination impairment\n- Muscle tightness and spasm\n- Dizziness, nausea (patients with cervical vertigo may encounter these symptoms)\n- Fever (might indicate an infection extending into the brain)\n---\n# Red Flags\n- **Symptoms pattern** (worsening of symptoms, recent bladder or bowel issue, sensory changes, unsteady gait, age above 50, previous history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, severely limiting range of motion (ROM) or pain, 5 D’s or 3 N’s, boy temperature over 36 degree, blood pressure (BP) above 160/95, and resting pulse higher than 100bpm)\n- **Family history** (Any history of cardiovascular disease or any relevant pathology)\n- **Cranial Nerves** (If applicable i.e., you have suspicion they may be involved, test all 12 nerves)\n- **Psychosocial factors** (factors that stop individual from sleeping, returning to activity, or causes extreme pain), despite not including in red flags, should also be taken into consideration.",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for most acute neck pain is good, with symptoms typically resolving within a few weeks to two months.\n\n**However**, some individuals may continue to experience pain or frequent recurrences, with up to 50% still having some issues after one year. \n\nA small percentage of acute cases may become chronic, especially in those with initial symptoms lasting longer than three months.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "**If any red flags have been identified, patient must be referred immediately or have an urgent appointment for investigation. When it comes to treatment, should the patient not present with any red flags.** \n\nThe NICE guidelines and other research advise management for acute neck pain as following:\n1. **RoM exercise with gravity as assistance** (e.g. being sat up with flexion, extension, side flexion, and rotation)\n1. **RoM exercise against gravity** (progress with minimal gravity resistance)\n1. **Isometric holds** (then we will progress to isometric holds and strengthening exercises, such as using therabands)\n1. **Sport specific** (In later stage of the treatment, we would then combine with sport specific exercises, such as holding a golf club and practicing a swing slowly to begin with, then progress to using a ball etc.)"

  "Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)": {
    "Summarizing": "## Introduction\n\nThe term ‘thoracic outlet syndrome’ (TOS) refers to the compression of the neurovascular structures, primarily the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and the subclavian vein, as they exit through the thoracic outlet also known as the cervicothoracobrachial region.\n\nAnatomically, the thoracic outlet is bordered anteriorly by the anterior scalene muscle, posteriorly by the middle scalene , and inferiorly by the first rib .( area serves as a passageway for nerves and blood vessels travelling from the neck to the arm.\n\nTOS is considered as one of the most controversial topics in musculoskeletal medicine and rehabilitation, partly due to its complex presentation and challenges in diagnosis(\n\nThe term ‘TOS’ does not identify the specific structure being compressed. Clinically it is typically divided into two main categories:\n\n-   Vascular TOS, which may involve compression of the subclavian artery or vein and generally presents with fewer diagnostic problems.\n-   Neurogenic TOS which involves compression of the brachial plexus and accounts for more than 90% of all TOS cases.\n\nTo improve diagnostic clarity, TOS should be classified as arterial TOS (ATOS), venous TOS (VTOS), or neurogenic (NTOS), depending on the structure affected.\n\n---\n## Clinically Relevant Anatomy\n\nThe thoracic outlet consists of three main passageways through which neurovascular structures travel from the neck to the upper limb. Compression at any of these sites can contribute to thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).\n\n### Interscalene Triangle\n\nThe first narrowing area is the most proximal and is named the interscalene triangle: This triangle is bordered by:\n\n-   Anteriorly by the anterior scalene muscle\n-   Posteriorly by the middle scalene muscle\n-   Inferiorly by the first rib\n\nThe brachial plexus and subclavian artery pass through this space. Anatomical variations, such as the presence of the scalene minimus muscle or overlapping insertion of the anterior and middle scalenes on the first rib, can reduce the available space and contribute to compression.\n\n### Costoclavicular Space\n\nThe second passageway is called the costoclavicular space (or triangle), and is bordered\n\n-   Superiorly by the middle third of the clavicle\n-   Inferiorly by the first rib\n-   Posteriorly and medially by the costoclavicular ligament\n\nThe subclavian vein, subclavian artery, and brachial plexus pass through this space. Compression of these structures can occur as a result of congenital abnormalities, trauma to the first rib or clavicle fractures. Structural changes in the subclavian muscle or the costocoracoid ligament can also be contributing factors.\n\n### Subcoracoid (Sub-Pectoralis Minor) Space\n\nThe final passage lies beneath the coracoid process, just under the tendon of pectoralis minor. It is bordered:\n\n-   Superiorly by the coracoid process\n-   Anteriorly by the pectoralis minor muscle\n-   Posteriorly by ribs 2-4 posteriorly.\n\n  \nShortening or tightness of the Pectoralis Major can lead to narrowing of this space, particularly during hyperabduction, resulting in neurovascular compression.\n\n---\n### Anatomical Variants and Contributing Factors\n\nSeveral congenital or acquired **anatomical abnormalities** can further compromise the thoracic outlet, including:\n\n-   The presence of a cervical rib\n-   Congenital soft tissue abnormalities\n-   Long C7 transverse process\n-   Fibrous bands or muscular anomalies (e.g. a broad scalene attachment or hypertrophied scalenes)\n-   Clavicular hypomobility\n-   Scoliosis or elevated scapula\n-   Functionally acquired anatomical changes\n\nSoft tissue abnormalities may create compression or tension loading of the neurovascular structures found within the thoracic outlet (such as hypertrophy, a broader middle scalene attachment on the 1st rib, or fibrous bands that increase stiffness).\n\n---\n#### **Neurological and Entrapment Syndromes**\n\n-   **Cervical radiculopathy** – Nerve root compression causing dermatomal pain, weakness, and sensory changes.\n-   **Nerve root compression (discogenic or spondylotic)** – Often due to disc herniation or degeneration, mimicking neurogenic symptoms.\n-   **Carpal tunnel syndrome** – Median nerve entrapment at the wrist causing numbness in the thumb and fingers.\n-   **Cubital tunnel syndrome** – Ulnar nerve compression at the elbow, resulting in tingling or weakness in the ring and little fingers.\n-   **Radial tunnel syndrome** – Entrapment of the radial nerve causing pain over the lateral forearm.\n-   **Brachial plexus trauma** – Nerve injury from trauma, often acute and with a known mechanism.\n-   **Parsonage-Turner syndrome** – Sudden onset of shoulder pain followed by muscle weakness and wasting.\n-   **Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy** – Late complication of radiotherapy presenting with progressive weakness or sensory loss.\n-   **Complex regional pain syndrome \"Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)\") (CRPS I and II)** – Chronic regional pain with autonomic and sensory abnormalities.\n-   **Sympathetic-mediated pain** – Neuropathic pain due to sympathetic overactivity.\n-   **Thoracic (T4) syndrome** – Upper thoracic dysfunction with diffuse arm pain, paraesthesia, and autonomic symptoms.\n-   **Horner’s syndrome** – Ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis due to sympathetic disruption, sometimes indicating a serious underlying pathology.\n\n---\n#### **Musculoskeletal Disorders**\n\n-   **Rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear** – Shoulder pain and weakness during overhead activity, without neurological signs.\n-   **Glenohumeral joint instability** – Recurrent shoulder subluxation or dislocation, often during movement.\n-   **Shoulder impingement syndrome** – Compression of soft tissues under the acromion during elevation.\n-   **Lateral_Toolkit \"Lateral Epicondyle Tendinopathy (Tennis Elbow) Toolkit\") and medial epicondylitis** – Overuse injuries at the elbow causing localised pain.\n-   **De Quervain’s tenosynovitis** – Pain and swelling near the base of the thumb from tendon inflammation.\n-   **Fibromyalgia** – Widespread pain and tenderness affecting multiple regions, including the neck and shoulders.\n\n---\n#### **Vascular Conditions**\n\n-   **Paget-Schroetter syndrome** – Effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein, often seen in athletes.\n-   **Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT)** – Venous obstruction presenting with swelling, heaviness, and cyanosis.\n-   **Raynaud’s phenomenon** – Vasospasm in fingers triggered by cold or stress, leading to colour changes and numbness.\n-   **Vasculitis** – Inflammatory condition of blood vessels that may mimic vascular TOS.\n-   **Arterial TOS** – Compression of the subclavian artery causing limb ischaemia.\n-   **Other vascular occlusions** – Rare causes of limb ischaemia unrelated to thoracic outlet compression.\n\n---\n#### **Systemic and Red Flag Conditions**\n\n-   **Pancoast tumour (apical lung tumour)** – May compress the lower brachial plexus and present with arm pain and Horner’s syndrome.\n-   **Malignancies compressing the brachial plexus** – Tumours in the neck or thorax producing similar symptoms to neurogenic TOS.\n-   **Cardiac conditions (e.g. angina, referred chest pain)** – May present as upper chest or arm discomfort during exertion.\n-   **Oesophageal disorders** – Can refer pain to the upper chest or neck, mimicking TOS.\n-   **Inflammatory or autoimmune diseases** – Systemic disorders that may affect nerves or vessels and mimic TOS features.",

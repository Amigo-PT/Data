  "Cervicogenic Headache": {
    "Summarizing": "**Cervicogenic headache (CGH):** is a chronic headache that arises from the *atlanto-occipital* and *upper cervical joints* and perceived in one or more regions of the head and/or face.\n\n**A cervicogenic headache** is a common cause of a *chronic headache that is often misdiagnosed*. The presenting features can be complex and similar to many primary headache syndromes that are encountered daily. \n\n\nThe main symptoms of a cervicogenic headache are a combination of:\n1. unilateral pain\n1. ipsilateral diffuse shoulder\n1. arm pain. \n\nROM in the neck is reduced, and pain is relieved with anesthetic blockades.\n\n---\n\n#  Clinical Relevant Anatomy\n\nThe cervical spine consists of 7 vertebrae, C1 to C7, the cervical nerves from C1 to C8, muscles and ligaments, The first two vertebrae have a unique shape and function.They form the upper cervical spine.\n\n\n- The upper vertebrae supports the skull (atlas/C1), articulates superiorly with the occiput (the atlanto-occipital joint) . This joint is responsible for 33% of flexion and extension.The design of the atlas allows forward and backward movement of the head.\n- Below the atlas is the axis (C2) that allows rotation.The atlantoaxial joint is responsible for 60% of all cervical rotation.\n- The 5 cervical vertebrae that make up the lower cervical spine, C3-C7, are similar to each other but very different from C1 and C2.\n\n---\n# Pathophysiology\n- The C1-C3 nerves relay pain signals to the nociceptive nucleus of the head and neck, the trigeminocervical nucleus. This connection is thought to be the cause for referred pain to the occiput and/or eyes.\n- Aseptic inflammation and neurotransmission within the C-fibers that is caused by cervical disc pathology is thought to produce and worsen the pain in a cervicogenic headache.\n- The trigeminocervical nucleus receives afferents from the trigeminal nerve as well as the upper three cervical spinal nerves. Neck trauma, whiplash, strain, or chronic spasm of the scalp, neck, or shoulder muscles can increase the sensitivity of the area which is similar to the allodynia that is seen in late chronic migraines.\n- A lower pain threshold makes patients more susceptible to more severe pain. For this reason, early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention is very important.\n\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\nChallenging to diagnose clinically, but often includes the below:\n- Unilateral “ram’s horn” or unilateral dominant headache (Excluding those with bilateral headache or symptoms that typify migraine headaches).\n- Exacerbated by neck movement or posture\n- Tenderness of the upper 3 cervical spine joints\n- Association with neck pain or dysfunction\n- Definitive diagnosis made through selective nerve blocking through injection of specific sites\n- Compared to migraine headache and control groups, cervicogenic headache group patients tend to have increased tightness and trigger points in upper trapezius, levator scapulae, scalenes and suboccipital extensors\n- Weakness in the deep neck flexors\n- Increased activity in the superficial flexors\n- Atrophy in the suboccipital extensors and so the deep muscle sleeve which is important for active support of the cervical segments becomes impaired\n- Upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, levator scapulae, pectoralis major and minor, and short sub-occipital extensors have been implicated\n\n---\n# Differential Diagnosis\nIt is important to differentiate from serious pathology such as:\n- Vascular Pathologies of the Neck\n- Intracranial Pathology\n- Cervical Instability\n- Cervical Myelopathy\n- Occipital neuralgia\n---\n# Red Flags\n1. Sudden onset of a new severe headache.\n1. A worsening pattern of a pre-existing headache in the absence of obvious predisposing factors.\n1. Headache associated with fever, neck stiff ness, skin rash, and with a history of cancer, HIV, or other systemic illness.\n1. Headache associated with focal neurologic signs other than typical aura.\n1. Moderate or severe headache triggered by cough, exertion, or bearing down.\n1. New onset of a headache during or following pregnancy.\n\n***Patients with one or more red flags should be referred for an immediate medical consultation and further investigation.***",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for a **cervicogenic headache** varies from person to person, with mild cases sometimes resolving on their own, while more severe or chronic cases require professional treatment and may recur.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "***Although this type of headache is responsive to therapy oriented at treating the soft tissue restrictions, the method of examination, assessment, and treatment needs to be specific to the neck and occiput.*** \n\n\n---\n\n\n# Treatment\n- Cervical spine manipulation or mobilization\n- Strengthening exercises including deep neck flexors and upper quarter muscles\n- Thoracic spine thrust manipulation & exercise\n- C1-C2 Self-sustained Natural Apophyseal Glide (SNAG) shown to be effective for reducing cervicogenic headache symptoms\n\n**Jull et al** reported that a *six week* physiotherapy program including manual therapy and exercise interventions was an effective treatment option for reduction of cervicogenic headache symptoms and decreasing medication intake in both the short term and at one-year follow-up. \n\nAccording to the **Delphi study (2021)** conducted to get consensus on physiotherapy treatment in headaches, active mobilisation exercises, upper cervical spine mobilisations, passive mobilisation with movement, work-related ergonomic training, and active mobilisation with movement can be used in the treatment of Cervicogenic headaches."

  "General Neck Pain & Stiffness": {
    "Summarizing": "**Neck pain** is characterised by its sudden onset, typically lasting *less than three months*. \n\nThis discomfort can manifest as localised pain or radiate to the:\n- head\n- shoulders\n- arms\n\nVarious factors such as injury, disease, wear and tear, or poor biomechanics can stress the spine and lead to this type of pain. **However**, pinpointing the exact source of discomfort can be challenging. \n\nPotential contributing factors may include:\n- nerve damage\n- tissue scarring\n- arthritis\n- emotional effects of pain.\n\n\n---\n# Functional Anatomy\nThe cervical spine consists of several structural group:\n\n**Muscles:**\n\n- anterior muscles\n- posterior muscles\n- lateral muscles\n- muscles that feed into the neck\n\n**Ligaments :**\n \n- anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament\n- intertransverse ligaments\n- nucheal ligament\n- alar ligaments\n- apical ligaments of dens\n- yellow ligaments\n\n**Neurological structures:** \n- arteries\n- nerves\n- glands\n- 2 passageways\n\n---\n# Mechanism of injury and Differential Diagnosis\n\nUnderstanding the mechanism of acute neck pain and differential diagnosis are the key parts of a physiotherapy assessment process. Various sources can contribute to acute neck pain:\n\n- **Cervical muscle sprain** (Most common cause of acute neck pain, usually caused my overuse of the musculature e.g., sitting hunched over in a chair)\n- **Muscle weakness** (Training muscles asymmetrically can cause pain i.e., training upper traps more than lower traps can lead to overstimulation of the upper traps, the difference can cause pain)\n- **Concussion** (After a concussion, people may experience head and neck pain, it can start quickly after and last anywhere from a few days to months/years.) *Any symptoms that last longer than 3 months after is considered post-concussion syndrome*\n- **RTA** (Symptoms can occur suddenly or within a few days following an accident , similar to a concussion, how long the symptoms last can range)\n- **Whiplash** (This can occur within a RTA or from another type of trauma e.g., a fall)\n---\n# Risk Factors\n\nIdentifying and understanding risk factors is crucial for prevention and early diagnosis, as acute neck pain can potentially evolve into chronic conditions. Potential contributing risk factors include:\n\n1. Advanced age\n1. Female\n1. History of neck, shoulder, and pelvis trauma\n1. Psychological factors\n1. Lifestyle\n---\n# Classification\n\nAccording to the updated neck pain revision of the **Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA)** in 2017, these are the revised clinical guidelines for neck pain classification:\n\n- Neck pain with mobility deficits\n- Neck pain with movement coordination impairments\n- Neck pain with headaches\n- Neck pain with radiating pain\n---\n# Clinical Presentation\nEvery acute neck pain present differently, it often present with more than a simple pain in the neck. Typically, it is accompanied by:\n\n- Referred pain (headache, shoulder pain, upper or lower back pain, radiated pain with upper extremity numbness.) These pain can be explained by refereed or widespread pain from innervated cervical spine structure.\n- Mobility deficit (reduce range of motion)\n- Coordination impairment\n- Muscle tightness and spasm\n- Dizziness, nausea (patients with cervical vertigo may encounter these symptoms)\n- Fever (might indicate an infection extending into the brain)\n---\n# Red Flags\n- **Symptoms pattern** (worsening of symptoms, recent bladder or bowel issue, sensory changes, unsteady gait, age above 50, previous history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, severely limiting range of motion (ROM) or pain, 5 D’s or 3 N’s, boy temperature over 36 degree, blood pressure (BP) above 160/95, and resting pulse higher than 100bpm)\n- **Family history** (Any history of cardiovascular disease or any relevant pathology)\n- **Cranial Nerves** (If applicable i.e., you have suspicion they may be involved, test all 12 nerves)\n- **Psychosocial factors** (factors that stop individual from sleeping, returning to activity, or causes extreme pain), despite not including in red flags, should also be taken into consideration.",
    "Prognosis": "The prognosis for most acute neck pain is good, with symptoms typically resolving within a few weeks to two months.\n\n**However**, some individuals may continue to experience pain or frequent recurrences, with up to 50% still having some issues after one year. \n\nA small percentage of acute cases may become chronic, especially in those with initial symptoms lasting longer than three months.",
    "Treatment Strategy": "**If any red flags have been identified, patient must be referred immediately or have an urgent appointment for investigation. When it comes to treatment, should the patient not present with any red flags.** \n\nThe NICE guidelines and other research advise management for acute neck pain as following:\n1. **RoM exercise with gravity as assistance** (e.g. being sat up with flexion, extension, side flexion, and rotation)\n1. **RoM exercise against gravity** (progress with minimal gravity resistance)\n1. **Isometric holds** (then we will progress to isometric holds and strengthening exercises, such as using therabands)\n1. **Sport specific** (In later stage of the treatment, we would then combine with sport specific exercises, such as holding a golf club and practicing a swing slowly to begin with, then progress to using a ball etc.)"
